# National Voter File

We provide an easy-to-use, modern-era database with voter files for each of the fifty states. It uses a data model that represents a national voter file as well as associated campaign measures in a shared data warehouse.

We want to pull politics into the 21st century, and we're starting from the ground up.

## Our goals

* Reliable, up-to-date voter data for every state in the country (including address changes, and redrawn districts)
* Per-household insights, done by grouping voters together based on address
* Per-voter insights, such as when people change their names and genders

* And for thousands to use our voter file to power their campaigns' donation, canvassing, and phonebanking efforts!

## How can I help?

* First, join us on [Slack](http://goo.gl/forms/8SJRDlo7Lx2rUsan1).
* Then, take a look at [our todo list](http://waffle.io/getmovement/national-voter-file), and see where you'd like to contribute.
* Finally, learn how to [view and modify the relational model itself](https://github.com/getmovement/national-voter-file/tree/master/docker), the core of our work.
