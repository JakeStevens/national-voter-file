# Dimensional Data
This directory is used by the docker scripts to find data that will be loaded into some of the dimension tables. 
There is no actual data stored in the git repo since they are rather large. You can download a copy of these files from our
dropbox (ask on the slack channel for access to a share).

If you wish, you can generate your own copy of these files with the python script src/main/python/censusreporter/getCensus.python

There is a .gitignore on this directory which insures these big files are never committed to the repo.
